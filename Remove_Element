Problem: Remove Element
Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Example: 
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2]


Solution
def reomve_element(number,val):
    index =0
    for i in range(0,len(number)):
        if number[i] != val:
            number[index] = number[i]
            index +=1
            
    for delete_index in range(i, index-1, -1):
            del number[delete_index]
    return number

reomve_element([0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2],2)
