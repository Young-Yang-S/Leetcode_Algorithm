Question: Sqrt(x)
Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.
Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

 Example: 
 
Input: x = 8
Output: 2

Easy

This problem could be solved by using binary search, we know when x is larger than 2, then its squre root is less than x/2, so we can use binary partition until we find the result.

def squre(num):
    if num < 2:
        return num
    
    left, right = 2, num
    
    while left+1 < right:
        middle = int((left +right)/2)
        if middle *middle > num:
            right =middle
        elif middle * middle < num:
            left = middle
        else:
            return middle
        
    return left
 
num = 122
squre(num)
