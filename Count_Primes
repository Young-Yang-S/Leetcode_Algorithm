Questions: Count Primes

Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.


Example:

def countprimes(n):
    if n<=2:
        return 0
    
    dp = [True] * n
    dp[0] = dp[1] = False
    for i in range(2,n):
        if dp[i]:
            for j in range(i*i,n,i):
                dp[j] = False
    return sum(dp)

countprimes(10)


# This is a good example to keep in mind, because it is a trick to create a True list firstly, then we can update the non prime value by this way, like 2,4,6.... 3,6,9...... and then sum them up.
